## Problem Statement
Use divide and conquer to find stain in a cloth image.Take assumption for cloth image by your own

---
## How to use code
A quick and simplified answer is that Lorem Ipsum refers to text that the DTP (Desktop Publishing) industry use as replacement text when the real text is not available. ... Lorem Ipsum is dummy text which has no meaning however looks very similar to real text.
```
#Download project
git clone https://github.com/merazlab/daa 
```
Project Initialize 
```
cd daa
#create assignment-1 folder
mkdir assignment_01

#go to assignment-1
cd assignment_01

#Create file
touch readme.md
touch main.py
.
.
```

### Analysis

**Time Complexity**

We are iterating each row and thenusing binary search we are finding out the minimum el-ement in the row so the overall time complexity wouldbe O(mlogn) where m = number of rows, n = number of columns.

**Space Complexity**

Since  we  have  not  used  any  extradata structure in our algorithm so the space complexity would be O(1).
